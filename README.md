# Popcorntime
Personal Popcorntime Repo containing wip popcorn ;)
Currently holds two different subdirs/projects:


[popcorn-time-remote-mod](https://github.com/stephaneAG/Popcorntime/tree/master/popcorn-time-remote-mod)
=======================
mod of Popcorntime Remote that fixes/adds fcnalities
- [fixed] streamer functionality, for remote watching from any LAN/WAN device running the remote webapp
- [added] "(un)pause/(un)mute & sync" from PT desktop to PTR when opening/closing the streamer, for cross devices video current time share
- [added] "next on ended", for automatic loading of next video, if any, when the streamer video ends
- [added] "back to streamer", for automatic display of the streamer video when the video has been downloaded on desktop if the streamer was previously shown
- [modded] more 'native-like' layout & behavior ( ex: top menu bar), still wip ( nearly finished on the iPhone )

may be merged to the official repo someday

Available as a [webversion](http://stephaneadamgarnier.com/Popcorntime)
