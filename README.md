=======================
mod of MickdeGraaf's popcorn-time-remote that fixes/adds fcnalities
- [fixed] streamer functionality, for remote watching from any LAN/WAN device running the remote webapp
- [added] "(un)pause/(un)mute & sync" from PT desktop to PTR when opening/closing the streamer, for cross devices video current time share
- [added] "next on ended", for automatic loading of next video, if any, when the streamer video ends
- [added] "back to streamer", for automatic display of the streamer video when the video has been downloaded on desktop if the streamer was previously shown

may be merged to the official repo someday
